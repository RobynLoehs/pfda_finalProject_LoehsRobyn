## Description
When the program runs, a pop-up screen will appear and act as a screen saver. It will have imagery of a farm scene that scrolls from left to right.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- When the user clicks in the space, a random farm animal will appear.
- Feature 2
	- When the user presses the space button, it will toggle a rainstorm on or off.
- Feature 3 
	- When the user presses the "R" button, it will clear out all of the animals.

## Challenges
- Making an intricate and relatively detailed scene that will have to be programmed.
- Making the scene scroll scross the screen.
- Changing the scenery without changing the scroll ability and the scene itself
- Having a preset of pixelated animals and making a random one spawn

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
  The ideal outcome is that everything works as intended. When the program is run, a screen will pop up containing a farm scene that continuously scrolls from left to right. When the user clicks with LMB, farm animals will appear on screen. When the user presses the space button, a rainstorm will appear and disappear when the space bar is pressed again. When the "R" button is pressed, it will clear out all of the animals.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
  The bare minimum will include the following when the program is run:
- Pop up screen with farm scenery
- Farm scenery can scroll from left to right
- Rainstorm is able to spawn
- If not animals, clicking will spawn boughts of rain

- Week 3 (Final)
