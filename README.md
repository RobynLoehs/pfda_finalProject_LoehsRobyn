## Description
When the program is run, a pop up will appear on the user's screen. Within the popup is a simple farm scenery including green grass, a blue sky, and a red barn with a white roof. Puffy, white clouds will automatically begin to scroll across the screen in the upper portion of the sky. Every time the user clicks within the popup using the left mouse button, a simple, pink, round pig will appear on a random grass tile. Every time the program is run, the pigs will spawn in a different tile than tha last time. When the user presses the space bar, the sky will become grey and the clouds will become a dark grey. Rain will fall across the screen. If the user presses the space bar again, the sky will return to its prior blue color, the clouds their prior white color, and the rain will stop falling. When the user presses the "R" button, everything will reset to normal. The pigs will all disappear, and if the rain toggle is on, then the skies and clouds will return to their normal colors as well.
